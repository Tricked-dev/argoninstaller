## Why another mod installer

Skyclient and Feather "client" are both windows only and don't support importing custom mod repos. This makes it tedious to add your own mods and keep them updated TMod Installer aims to fix this issue allowing anyone to maintain a repo with their favorite mods and update it themself

## TMod Installer art

The current TMod installer art can be found here: https://www.figma.com/file/iH6zwbkTFIYeCuSMYHJxs1/TMOD-INSTALLER?node-id=0%3A1 feel free to dm me if your interested into making/have made new art to use anything is probably better than this same goes for the name of the project if you have a better idea lol.
