## Why another mod installer

Feather "client" is currently both windows only and paid, and free alternatives such as Skyclient don't support importing custom mod your own custom repos. This makes it tedious to add your own mods and keep them updated. ArgonInstaller aims to fix this issue allowing anyone to maintain a repo with their favorite mods and update it themself

## ArgonInstaller art

The current Argon installer art can be found here: <https://www.figma.com/file/iH6zwbkTFIYeCuSMYHJxs1/Argon-INSTALLER?node-id=0%3A1> feel free to dm me if your interested into making/have made new art to use anything is probably better than this same goes for the name of the project if you have a better idea lol.
